## Description

Logical modules must be developed and validated independently before integration into code satisfying specific requirements. Each module must have clear boundaries, interfaces, and validation criteria defined before development begins.

## Rationale

To eliminate bugs related to code complexity by ensuring each module works correctly in isolation before combining with other modules. Independent validation reduces integration complexity, catches bugs early in the development cycle, and ensures each module meets its defined contract before integration.

## Satisfaction Criteria

- All logical modules are identified and documented with clear boundaries before development
- Module interfaces and contracts are defined and documented
- Module validation criteria are specified (what "validated" means for each module)
- Each module is developed independently
- Each module passes independent validation (unit tests with mocks, integration tests with test doubles, contract validation, edge case testing, error handling validation) before integration
- Module validation results are documented
- Integration tasks are separate from module development and validation tasks
- Integration only occurs after module validation passes

## Validation Criteria

- Manual verification that modules are identified and documented before development
- Automated verification that module validation tests exist and pass before integration
- Code review verification that integration code references validated modules
- Verification that module validation results are documented
- Verification that integration tests validate the combined behavior of validated modules

## Traceability

- **Architecture**: `ARCH-MODULE_VALIDATION` (see `architecture-decisions.yaml`)
- **Implementation**: `IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION` (see `implementation-decisions.yaml`)
- **Tests**: `testModuleName_IndependentValidation_REQ_MODULE_VALIDATION` in test files
- **Code**: `// [REQ-MODULE_VALIDATION] Module validated independently` in source files

_Note: In `requirements.yaml`, traceability is stored as structured YAML lists for programmatic querying._

## Related Requirements

- **Depends on**: [REQ-STDD_SETUP] (needs STDD methodology in place)
- **Related to**: All feature requirements that involve modular design
- **Supersedes**: None
