## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **Structured YAML Schema** [v1.5.0 Schema Enhancement]: Restructured all three YAML index files to use machine-parseable structured fields instead of markdown-formatted string blobs
  - **traceability field**: Now a structured map with separate lists for `architecture[]`, `implementation[]`, `tests[]`, and `code_annotations[]` (previously markdown-formatted string)
  - **rationale field**: Now a structured map with `why`, `problems_solved[]`, and `benefits[]` (previously plain string)
  - **satisfaction_criteria** (requirements): Now a list of structured items with `criterion` and optional `metric` (previously markdown-formatted string)
  - **validation_criteria** (requirements): Now a list of structured items with `method` and `coverage` (previously markdown-formatted string)
  - **alternatives_considered** (architecture): Now a list of structured items with `name`, `pros[]`, `cons[]`, and `rejected_reason` (previously markdown-formatted string)
  - **implementation_approach** (architecture/implementation): Now a structured map with `summary` and `details[]` (previously markdown-formatted string)
  - **code_markers → code_locations** (implementation): Renamed and restructured with `files[]` and `functions[]` lists with structured metadata (previously markdown-formatted string)
  - **metadata field**: Grouped flat fields (`created`, `last_updated`, `last_validated`, `last_validator`) into structured maps with date/author/reason/result sub-fields
  - Enables direct field access: `yq '.REQ-X.traceability.architecture[]'` instead of parsing markdown text
  - Enables structured queries: `yq '.REQ-X.satisfaction_criteria[].criterion'`
  - Better validation and tool integration support

- **YAML Database Indexes** [PROC-YAML_DB_OPERATIONS]: Transformed all three index files from Markdown tables to YAML database files for improved programmatic access and append-only semantics

  - `architecture-decisions.template.yaml` - YAML database with all architecture decision records (replaces Markdown tables in architecture-decisions.template.md)
  - `implementation-decisions.template.yaml` - YAML database with all implementation decision records (replaces Markdown tables in implementation-decisions.template.md)
  - Each YAML file includes comprehensive header documentation and template blocks for easy appending
  - Schema tailored per type with structured fields (see Structured YAML Schema above)
  - Append-only design: copy template block from bottom, paste at end, fill fields
  - Enables programmatic querying with `yq`, `grep`, Python `yaml.safe_load()`, and other YAML tools

- **YAML Operations Process Documentation** [PROC-YAML_DB_OPERATIONS]: Comprehensive process guide in `processes.template.md`

- **`copy_files.sh`**: Updated to copy YAML template files
  - Added `requirements.template.yaml` to TEMPLATE_FILES array
  - Added `architecture-decisions.template.yaml` to TEMPLATE_FILES array
  - Added `implementation-decisions.template.yaml` to TEMPLATE_FILES array

- **Version Alignment**: Updated all methodology files to STDD v1.5.0
  - `AGENTS.md`: v1.5.0
  - `ai-principles.md`: v1.2.0, STDD v1.5.0
  - `semantic-tokens.template.md`: v1.5.0
  - `requirements.template.md`: v1.5.0
  - `architecture-decisions.template.md`: v1.5.0
  - `implementation-decisions.template.md`: v1.5.0

- **`semantic-tokens.template.md`**: Updated all references to mention `.yaml` index files alongside `.md` guide files
  - Added `[PROC-YAML_DB_OPERATIONS]` to Process Tokens Registry

- **`AGENTS.md`**: Updated Key Files table and Section 2 to reference `.yaml` index files

  - Change Impact Tracking matrix updated to use `.yaml` files
  - All checklist items updated to reference `.yaml` files

- **`STDD.md`**: Updated references to mention YAML index format in documentation outputs and template file listings

### Benefits

- **Direct Field Access**: `yq '.REQ-X.traceability.architecture[]'` instead of parsing markdown strings
- **Structured Queries**: `yq '.REQ-X.satisfaction_criteria[].criterion'` for targeted data extraction
- **Easy Filtering**: `yq '.REQ-X.metadata.last_validated.result'` for validation status checks
- **Programmatic Access**: Query, filter, and validate indexes using standard YAML tools (`yq`, Python, etc.)
- **Append-Only Semantics**: Add new records by copying template block and pasting at end - reduces merge conflicts
- **Structured Data**: YAML provides proper data types (lists, maps, multi-line strings) vs. Markdown table text or string blobs
- **Easier Validation**: `yq '.' file.yaml` validates syntax; custom scripts can validate cross-references and field structure
- **Better Tooling**: Standard YAML parsers available in all languages with native support for structured queries
- **Consistent Format**: No Markdown table formatting issues or alignment problems
- **Preserve Detail Files**: Detail `.md` files remain unchanged - only indexes converted to YAML with structured fields

### Rationale

**Schema Restructuring (v1.5.0)**: Markdown-formatted string blobs in YAML fields require text parsing and regex matching for programmatic access. Structured YAML fields enable direct queries (`yq '.field.subfield[]'`), type safety, easier validation, and better tool integration. This change completes the transformation from human-only readable Markdown to machine-readable structured data while maintaining human readability.

**YAML Database Indexes (v1.4.0 foundation)**: Markdown tables become unwieldy for programmatic operations (filtering, querying, validation). YAML provides:
1. **Machine-readable structure** while maintaining human readability
2. **Append-only workflow** that minimizes merge conflicts
3. **Rich data types** (lists, maps, multi-line strings) vs. plain text in table cells
4. **Standard tooling** available across all programming languages
5. **Easier validation** of both syntax and semantic consistency

The `.md` guide files explain how to use the YAML indexes, while the YAML files themselves serve as the canonical database. Detail files remain in Markdown for narrative documentation.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- **Scalable Requirements Structure**: Transformed `requirements.template.md` from a monolithic file into an index + detail files pattern for scalability
  - Main file now serves as a lightweight **index** with a table of all requirements
  - Individual requirements stored in `requirements.template/` directory as separate files (e.g., `REQ-STDD_SETUP.md`)
  - Mirrors the architecture-decisions (v1.3.0) and implementation-decisions (v1.2.0) structure
  - Status tracking per requirement: ✅ Implemented, ⏳ Planned, Template
  - Optional domain-based grouping for very large projects

- **Requirements Migration Guide** (`migrate-requirements.md`): Comprehensive AI agent instructions for migrating existing projects from monolithic requirements files to the new scalable structure
  - Pre-migration checklist
  - Step-by-step migration process with commands
  - Post-migration verification
  - Handling special cases (missing tokens, duplicates, cross-references)
  - Complete worked example
  - Rollback procedure

- **Example Requirements Detail Files** (`requirements.template/`): Complete reference implementations
  - `REQ-STDD_SETUP.md`
  - `REQ-MODULE_VALIDATION.md`
  - `REQ-IDENTIFIER.md` (template example)

### Changed

- **`requirements.template.md`**: Now contains index table, detail file template, and instructions for the new structure
- **`copy_files.sh`**: Updated to copy requirements detail files from `requirements.template/` directory
- **`semantic-tokens.template.md`**: Updated Requirements Tokens Registry reference to point to both index and detail files directory
- **Cross-references**: Updated `ai-principles.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `STDD.md` to reflect new requirements structure
- **Version Alignment**: Updated all methodology files to STDD v1.4.0

### Rationale

As projects grow, monolithic requirements files become unwieldy for both humans and AI agents. This change (completing the pattern started with implementation-decisions in v1.2.0 and architecture-decisions in v1.3.0) preserves all information while enabling:
- Faster navigation and context loading
- Cleaner git history per-requirement
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Domain-based organization for large projects
- Consistent pattern across all STDD documentation types (requirements, architecture, implementation)

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-17

### Added

- **Unified Semantic Token Format**: Standardized all semantic tokens from colon format (`[TYPE:IDENTIFIER]`) to hyphen format (`[TYPE-IDENTIFIER]`)
  - Enables single regex pattern for both text and filenames
  - Consistent mental model - tokens look the same everywhere
  - Simplified tooling - no format translation needed
  - Easier searchability - agents can use one pattern for all contexts

- **Scalable Architecture Decisions Structure**: Transformed `architecture-decisions.template.md` from a monolithic file into an index + detail files pattern for scalability
  - Main file now serves as a lightweight **index** with a table of all architecture decisions
  - Individual decisions stored in `architecture-decisions/` directory as separate files (e.g., `ARCH-STDD_STRUCTURE.md`)
  - Mirrors the implementation-decisions structure from v1.2.0
  - Status tracking per decision: Active, Deprecated, Template, Superseded
  - Optional domain-based grouping for very large projects

- **Token Format Migration Guide** (`migrate-semantic-token-format.md`): Comprehensive AI agent instructions for migrating existing projects from colon-based tokens to hyphen-based tokens
  - Pre-migration checklist
  - Automated sed/grep commands for bulk replacement
  - Universal migration script
  - Post-migration verification steps
  - Rollback procedure

- **Architecture Decisions Migration Guide** (`migrate-architecture-decisions.md`): Comprehensive AI agent instructions for migrating existing projects from monolithic architecture-decisions files to the new scalable structure
  - Pre-migration checklist
  - Step-by-step migration process with commands
  - Post-migration verification
  - Handling special cases (missing tokens, duplicates, cross-references)
  - Complete worked example
  - Rollback procedure

- **Example Architecture Detail Files** (`architecture-decisions.template/`): Complete reference implementations
  - `ARCH-STDD_STRUCTURE.md`
  - `ARCH-MODULE_VALIDATION.md`
  - `ARCH-EXAMPLE_DECISION.md`

### Changed

- **All Documentation Files**: Updated to use hyphen-based token format (`[TYPE-IDENTIFIER]`)
- **`architecture-decisions.template.md`**: Now contains index table, detail file template, and instructions for the new structure
- **`semantic-tokens.template.md`**: Updated Architecture Tokens Registry reference to point to both index and detail files directory
- **Version Alignment**: Updated all methodology files to STDD v1.3.0

### Rationale

**Token Format Change**: The colon (`:`) character is invalid in filenames on many operating systems. Previously this required different patterns for tokens in text vs. filenames. The hyphen format unifies both, enabling single-pattern matching and simplified tooling.

**Architecture Decisions Structure**: As projects grow, monolithic documentation files become unwieldy for both humans and AI agents. This change (mirroring the v1.2.0 implementation-decisions change) preserves all information while enabling faster navigation, cleaner git history, reduced merge conflicts, and domain-based organization.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-17

### Added

- **Scalable Implementation Decisions Structure**: Transformed `implementation-decisions.template.md` from a monolithic file into an index + detail files pattern for scalability
  - Main file now serves as a lightweight **index** with a table of all implementation decisions
  - Individual decisions stored in `implementation-decisions/` directory as separate files (e.g., `IMPL-CONFIG_STRUCT.md`)
  - Filename convention: Replace `:` with `-` to handle OS filename restrictions (`[IMPL-TOKEN]` → `IMPL-TOKEN.md`)
  - Status tracking per decision: Active, Deprecated, Template, Superseded
  - Optional domain-based grouping for very large projects

- **Migration Guide** (`migrate-implementation-decisions.md`): Comprehensive AI agent instructions for migrating existing projects from monolithic implementation-decisions files to the new scalable structure
  - Pre-migration checklist
  - Step-by-step migration process with commands
  - Post-migration verification
  - Handling special cases (missing tokens, duplicates, cross-references)
  - Complete worked example
  - Rollback procedure

- **Example Detail File** (`implementation-decisions.template/IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION.md`): Complete reference implementation of a detail file

- **`semantic-tokens.template.md`**: Updated Implementation Tokens Registry reference to point to both index and detail files directory
- **Version Alignment**: Updated all methodology files to STDD v1.2.0

### Rationale

As projects grow, monolithic documentation files become unwieldy for both humans and AI agents. This change preserves all information while enabling:
- Faster navigation and context loading
- Cleaner git history per-decision
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Domain-based organization for large projects

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-19

### Added

- **Processes as a Primary STDD Pillar** [PROC-PROJECT_SURVEY_AND_SETUP] [PROC-BUILD_PIPELINE_VALIDATION]: Elevated processes from optional guidance to a core methodology component so operational rituals remain traceable to requirements, architecture, and implementation tokens.

### Changed

- **Version Alignment**: Updated every methodology guide, template, and project copy to cite STDD v1.1.0 so downstream projects instantly inherit the processes-first workflow expectations.

### Rationale

Adding processes to the primary STDD methodology is a major capability improvement that affects every consumer of these templates, necessitating a version bump.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-01-27

### Added

- **Module Validation Requirement** [REQ-MODULE_VALIDATION]: Mandatory requirement for independent module validation before integration
  - Logical modules must be validated independently before integration into code satisfying specific requirements
  - Each module must have clear boundaries, interfaces, and validation criteria defined before development
  - Modules must pass independent validation (unit tests with mocks, integration tests with test doubles, contract validation, edge case testing, error handling validation) before integration
  - Integration only occurs after module validation passes
  - **Rationale**: Eliminates bugs related to code complexity by ensuring each module works correctly in isolation before combining with other modules

- **Module Validation Architecture Decision** [ARCH-MODULE_VALIDATION]: Architecture decision documenting the module validation strategy
  - Module identification requirements
  - Validation approach (unit testing, integration testing with test doubles, contract validation, edge case testing, error handling validation)
  - Integration requirements
  - Alternatives considered and rationale for rejection

- **Module Validation Implementation Decision** [IMPL-MODULE_VALIDATION]: Implementation decision documenting how module validation is implemented
  - Module identification phase
  - Module development phase
  - Module validation phase (before integration)
  - Integration phase (after validation)
  - Task structure and code markers

- **Template bootstrap script**: `copy_files.sh` copies every STDD template file into a target project’s `stdd/` directory, making STDD installation as easy as downloading the repository somewhere convenient and running the script from the desired project root.

### Changed

- **Development Process**: Enhanced Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 to include module identification, development, validation, and integration steps
- **AI-First Principles**: Added Principle 8 for independent module validation before integration
- **Task Template**: Updated to include module validation subtasks in task examples
- **All Templates**: Updated version numbers to 1.0.2

### Rationale

This enhancement addresses the need to eliminate bugs related to code complexity by requiring logical modules to be validated independently prior to integration. This ensures each module works correctly in isolation before combining with other modules, reducing integration complexity and catching bugs early in the development cycle.
