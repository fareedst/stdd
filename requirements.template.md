# Requirements Directory

**STDD Methodology Version**: 1.5.0

## Overview
This document serves as the **central listing/registry** for all requirements in this project. Each requirement is stored in its own file within the `requirements/` directory for scalability. Each requirement has a unique semantic token `[REQ-IDENTIFIER]` for traceability.

**For detailed information about how requirements are fulfilled, see:**
- **Architecture decisions**: See `architecture-decisions.md` for high-level design choices that fulfill requirements
- **Implementation decisions**: See `implementation-decisions.md` for detailed implementation approaches, APIs, and algorithms
- **Semantic tokens**: See `semantic-tokens.md` for the complete token registry

## Directory Structure

```
stdd/
├── requirements.md              # This guide file (you are here)
├── requirements.yaml            # YAML index/database of all requirements
├── requirements/                # Detail files directory
│   ├── REQ-STDD_SETUP.md
│   ├── REQ-MODULE_VALIDATION.md
│   └── ...
```

## Filename Convention

Token names use the same format in text and filenames:

| Token Format | Filename Format |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `[REQ-USER_AUTH]` | `REQ-USER_AUTH.md` |
| `[REQ-MODULE_VALIDATION]` | `REQ-MODULE_VALIDATION.md` |

**Rule**: Remove brackets, keep hyphen, append `.md`

## Notes

- All requirements MUST be documented here with `[REQ-*]` tokens
- Requirements describe WHAT the system should do and WHY, not HOW
- Requirements MUST NOT describe bugs or implementation details
- **Language-Agnostic Requirements**: Requirements MUST be language-agnostic. Language selection, runtime choices, and language-specific implementation details belong in architecture decisions (`architecture-decisions.md`) or implementation decisions (`implementation-decisions.md`), NOT in requirements. The ONLY exception is when language selection is itself a specific requirement (e.g., `[REQ-USE_PYTHON]` for a Python-specific project requirement). When documenting requirements, focus on behavior and capabilities, not on how they are implemented in a specific language.

## How to Add a New Requirement

1. **Create a new detail file** in `requirements/` using the naming convention above
2. **Use the detail file template** (see below)
3. **Add an entry to the index table** below
4. **Update `semantic-tokens.md`** registry with the new `[REQ-*]` token

## Requirements Index

**The requirements index is maintained in `requirements.yaml`**, a YAML database file that contains all requirement records with their metadata, cross-references, and status.

To view the index:

```bash
# View entire index
cat stdd/requirements.yaml

# View specific requirement
yq '.REQ-STDD_SETUP' stdd/requirements.yaml

# Get satisfaction criteria for a requirement
yq '.REQ-STDD_SETUP.satisfaction_criteria[].criterion' stdd/requirements.yaml

# Get validation methods for a requirement
yq '.REQ-STDD_SETUP.validation_criteria[].method' stdd/requirements.yaml

# Get architecture dependencies for a requirement
yq '.REQ-STDD_SETUP.traceability.architecture[]' stdd/requirements.yaml

# List all requirements by status
yq 'to_entries | map(select(.value.status == "Implemented")) | from_entries' stdd/requirements.yaml

# Quick grep search
grep -A 30 '^REQ-STDD_SETUP:' stdd/requirements.yaml
```

### How to Append a New Requirement

1. Open `requirements.yaml` in your editor
2. Copy the template block at the bottom of the file (REQ-IDENTIFIER)
3. Paste it at the end with a blank line before it
4. Replace `REQ-IDENTIFIER` with your new semantic token
5. Fill in all fields (name, category, priority, status, rationale, etc.)
6. Update the `detail_file` path to match your new `.md` file in `requirements/` directory
7. Save the file

Example append operation:

```bash
cat >> stdd/requirements.yaml << 'EOF'

REQ-NEW_FEATURE:
  name: New Feature Name
  category: Functional
  priority: P1
  status: "Planned"
  rationale:
    why: "Primary reason for this requirement"

      - "Benefit 2"

### Status Values

- **✅ Implemented**: Requirement is fully implemented and validated
- **⏳ Planned**: Requirement is documented but not yet implemented
- **Template**: Example/template entry for reference

## Detail File Template

Use this template when creating a new requirement file in `requirements/`:

```markdown
# [REQ-IDENTIFIER] Requirement Name

**Category**: Functional | Non-Functional | Immutable  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical) | P1 (Important) | P2 (Nice-to-have) | P3 (Future)  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented | ⏳ Planned | Template  
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Description

What the requirement specifies (WHAT)

## Rationale

Why the requirement exists (WHY)

## Satisfaction Criteria

- How we know the requirement is satisfied
- Acceptance criteria
- Success conditions

## Validation Criteria

- How we verify/validate the requirement is met
- Testing approach
- Verification methods
- Success metrics

## Traceability

- **Architecture**: See `architecture-decisions.md` § [ARCH-IDENTIFIER]
- **Implementation**: See `implementation-decisions.md` § [IMPL-IDENTIFIER]
- **Tests**: `testFeatureName_REQ_IDENTIFIER` in test files
- **Code**: `// [REQ-IDENTIFIER] Implementation comment` in source files

## Related Requirements

- **Depends on**: (if applicable)
- **Related to**: (if applicable)
- **Supersedes**: (if this replaces another requirement)

## Quick Reference: Creating a New Requirement

```bash
# 1. Create the detail file
touch stdd/requirements/REQ-YOUR_TOKEN.md

# 2. Copy the template above into the new file

# 3. Fill in the details

# 4. Add entry to the index table in this file

# 5. Update semantic-tokens.md registry
```

---

## Grouping by Domain (Optional)

For very large projects, organize detail files by domain:

```
requirements/
├── core/
│   ├── REQ-STDD_SETUP.md
│   └── REQ-MODULE_VALIDATION.md
├── auth/
│   ├── REQ-USER_LOGIN.md
│   └── REQ-SESSION_MGMT.md
└── api/
    └── REQ-REST_ENDPOINTS.md
```

When using subdirectories, update the Detail File column in the index:
```markdown
| `[REQ-USER_LOGIN]` | User Login | P0 | ✅ Implemented | Auth | ... | [Detail](requirements/auth/REQ-USER_LOGIN.md) |
```

---

## Migration from Monolithic File

If migrating from a single monolithic `requirements.md` file, see `migrate-requirements.md` for step-by-step instructions.

---

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

The following features are documented but marked as future enhancements:
- Each requirement should cross-reference architecture and implementation decisions
- Automated requirement validation tools
- Requirement dependency graph visualization

These may be considered for future iterations but are not required for the initial implementation.
