# Requirements Directory

**STDD Methodology Version**: 1.0.1

## Overview
This document serves as the **central listing/registry** for all requirements in this project. Each requirement has a unique semantic token `[REQ:IDENTIFIER]` for traceability.

**For detailed information about how requirements are fulfilled, see:**
- **Architecture decisions**: See `architecture-decisions.md` for high-level design choices that fulfill requirements
- **Implementation decisions**: See `implementation-decisions.md` for detailed implementation approaches, APIs, and algorithms
- **Semantic tokens**: See `semantic-tokens.md` for the complete token registry

### Requirement Structure

Each requirement includes:
- **Description**: What the requirement specifies (WHAT)
- **Rationale**: Why the requirement exists (WHY)
- **Satisfaction Criteria**: How we know the requirement is satisfied (acceptance criteria, success conditions)
- **Validation Criteria**: How we verify/validate the requirement is met (testing approach, verification methods, success metrics)

**Note**: 
- Satisfaction and validation criteria that involve architectural or implementation details reference the appropriate layers
- Architecture decisions in `architecture-decisions.md` explain HOW requirements are fulfilled at a high level
- Implementation decisions in `implementation-decisions.md` explain HOW requirements are fulfilled at a detailed level

## Detailed Requirements

### Core Functionality

### [REQ:STDD_SETUP] STDD Methodology Setup

**Priority: P0 (Critical)**

- **Description**: The project must follow the Semantic Token-Driven Development (STDD) methodology, including a specific directory structure (`stdd/`) and documentation files (`requirements.md`, `architecture-decisions.md`, etc.).
- **Rationale**: To ensure traceability of intent from requirements to code and to maintain a consistent development process.
- **Satisfaction Criteria**:
  - `stdd/` directory exists.
  - All required documentation files exist and are populated from templates.
  - `.cursorrules` contains the STDD rules.
- **Validation Criteria**:
  - Manual verification of file existence.
  - AI agent acknowledgment of principles.
- **Architecture**: See `architecture-decisions.md` § STDD Project Structure [ARCH:STDD_STRUCTURE]
- **Implementation**: See `implementation-decisions.md` § STDD File Creation [IMPL:STDD_FILES]

**Status**: ✅ Implemented

### [REQ:IDENTIFIER] Requirement Name

**Priority: P0 (Critical) | P1 (Important) | P2 (Nice-to-have) | P3 (Future)**

- **Description**: What the requirement specifies
- **Rationale**: Why the requirement exists
- **Satisfaction Criteria**:
  - How we know the requirement is satisfied
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Success conditions
- **Validation Criteria**: 
  - How we verify/validate the requirement is met
  - Testing approach
  - Verification methods
  - Success metrics
- **Architecture**: See `architecture-decisions.md` § Decision Name [ARCH:IDENTIFIER]
- **Implementation**: See `implementation-decisions.md` § Implementation Name [IMPL:IDENTIFIER]

**Status**: ✅ Implemented | ⏳ Planned
```

## Notes

- All requirements MUST be documented here with `[REQ:*]` tokens
- Requirements describe WHAT the system should do and WHY, not HOW
- Requirements MUST NOT describe bugs or implementation details

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

The following features are documented but marked as future enhancements:
- Each requirement should cross-reference architecture and implementation decisions
