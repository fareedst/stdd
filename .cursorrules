# Cursor AI Agent Rules for STDD Projects

**STDD Methodology Version**: 1.0.0

## 🎯 Semantic Token-Driven Development (STDD)

This project follows **Semantic Token-Driven Development (STDD)**, where semantic tokens (`[REQ:*]`, `[ARCH:*]`, `[IMPL:*]`) are the central mechanism for preserving intent throughout the development lifecycle. Semantic tokens create a traceable chain of intent from requirements → architecture → implementation → tests → code, ensuring the original purpose and reasoning are never lost.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: AI Principles Acknowledgment

**YOU MUST** acknowledge that you have read and will follow the AI principles at the start of EVERY response by prefacing with:

**"Observing AI principles!"**

Then proceed to:
1. Read `stdd/ai-principles.md` if not already read in this session
2. Check `stdd/semantic-tokens.md` for existing tokens
3. Review `stdd/tasks.md` for active tasks
4. Follow all principles throughout your response

## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Always Reference ai-principles.md**
   - Read `stdd/ai-principles.md` at the start of each session
   - Acknowledge with "Observing AI principles!" at the start of every response
   - Follow the documented development process
   - Use semantic tokens consistently

2. **Semantic Token System** (Core to STDD)
   - Semantic tokens are the mechanism that preserves intent throughout the development lifecycle
   - Use semantic tokens for all cross-referencing
   - Format: `[TYPE:IDENTIFIER]` (e.g., `[REQ:FEATURE]`, `[IMPL:IMPLEMENTATION]`)
   - Reference tokens in code comments, test names, and documentation
   - Update `stdd/semantic-tokens.md` when creating new tokens
   - Maintain traceability: Requirements → Architecture → Implementation → Tests → Code

3. **Development Process**
   - **Phase 1**: Expand requirements into pseudo-code and decisions (NO code changes)
   - **Phase 2**: Break down into trackable tasks with priorities
   - **Phase 3**: Implement tasks, starting with highest priority
   - Always cross-reference using semantic tokens

4. **Task Management**
   - Break work into trackable tasks in `stdd/tasks.md`
   - Assign priorities: P0 (Critical) > P1 (Important) > P2 (Nice-to-have) > P3 (Future)
   - Remove subtasks when parent task completes
   - Always include semantic token references

5. **Priority Order**
   - **Most Important**: Tests, Code, Basic Functions
   - **Least Important**: Environment Orchestration, Enhanced Security, Automated Deployment

## 📝 Documentation Requirements

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Documentation is MANDATORY, Not Optional

**Documentation updates are REQUIRED at every stage of development. They are not optional or deferrable.**

### Required Sections in All Documentation

1. **Requirements** - with `[REQ:*]` tokens (in `stdd/requirements.md`)
2. **Architecture Decisions** - with `[ARCH:*]` tokens (in `stdd/architecture-decisions.md`)
   - **MUST** be recorded in `stdd/architecture-decisions.md` IMMEDIATELY when made
   - **MUST** cross-reference `[REQ:*]` tokens
   - Architecture decisions are dependent on requirements
   - **DO NOT** defer architecture documentation - record it as you make decisions
3. **Implementation Decisions** - with `[IMPL:*]` tokens (in `stdd/implementation-decisions.md`)
   - **MUST** be recorded in `stdd/implementation-decisions.md` IMMEDIATELY when made
   - **MUST** cross-reference both `[ARCH:*]` and `[REQ:*]` tokens
   - Implementation decisions are dependent on both architecture and requirements
   - **DO NOT** defer implementation documentation - record it as you make decisions
4. **Semantic Token Registry** - maintained in `stdd/semantic-tokens.md`
   - **MUST** be updated immediately when creating new tokens
5. **Task Planning** - maintained in `stdd/tasks.md`
   - **MUST** be updated when planning new work
   - **MUST** be updated when completing tasks
   - **MUST** include semantic token references
6. **Code References** - semantic tokens in code comments
7. **Test References** - semantic tokens in test names/comments

### Documentation Update Checklist (MANDATORY)

**When making ANY architectural decision:**
- [ ] Record in `stdd/architecture-decisions.md` with `[ARCH:*]` token
- [ ] Cross-reference relevant `[REQ:*]` tokens
- [ ] Update `stdd/semantic-tokens.md` if new token created

**When making ANY implementation decision:**
- [ ] Record in `stdd/implementation-decisions.md` with `[IMPL:*]` token
- [ ] Cross-reference relevant `[ARCH:*]` and `[REQ:*]` tokens
- [ ] Update `stdd/semantic-tokens.md` if new token created

**When planning new work:**
- [ ] Create tasks in `stdd/tasks.md` BEFORE starting implementation
- [ ] Assign priorities to all tasks
- [ ] Include semantic token references in task descriptions
- [ ] Break down into subtasks if needed

**When completing work:**
- [ ] Mark tasks complete in `stdd/tasks.md`
- [ ] Remove completed subtasks
- [ ] Verify all documentation is up-to-date
- [ ] Ensure all semantic tokens are documented

### Cross-Reference Format

When referencing tokens:
```javascript
// [REQ:FEATURE_NAME] Brief description
// [IMPL:IMPLEMENTATION_NAME] [ARCH:ARCHITECTURE_NAME] [REQ:FEATURE_NAME]
function featureFunction() {
    // ...
}
```

Test names:
```javascript
test('feature name REQ_FEATURE_NAME', () => {
    // ...
})
```

## 🔄 Before Starting Work

## 🎯 Example Workflow

1. **User Request**: "Add feature X"
2. **AI Response (Planning Phase - NO CODE YET)**: 
   - Creates `[REQ:FEATURE_X]` token in `stdd/requirements.md`
   - Expands into pseudo-code and decisions
   - **IMMEDIATELY** documents architecture decisions in `stdd/architecture-decisions.md` with `[ARCH:*]` tokens cross-referencing `[REQ:FEATURE_X]`
   - **IMMEDIATELY** documents implementation decisions in `stdd/implementation-decisions.md` with `[IMPL:*]` tokens cross-referencing both `[ARCH:*]` and `[REQ:*]` tokens
   - **IMMEDIATELY** updates `stdd/semantic-tokens.md` with all new tokens
   - **IMMEDIATELY** creates tasks in `stdd/tasks.md` with P1 priority and semantic token references
   - **NO code changes yet**
3. **User Approval**: User reviews and approves planning documents
4. **Implementation Phase**: 
   - AI implements tasks, starting with highest priority
   - **DURING implementation**: Updates documentation as decisions are made or refined
   - **DURING implementation**: Updates `stdd/tasks.md` as subtasks are completed
5. **Completion Phase**: 
   - **MANDATORY**: Verifies all documentation is up-to-date
   - **MANDATORY**: Marks tasks complete in `stdd/tasks.md`
   - **MANDATORY**: Removes completed subtasks
   - **MANDATORY**: Ensures all semantic tokens are documented
